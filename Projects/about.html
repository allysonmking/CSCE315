                <h2>Education</h2>
                <p> I am a Dallas native but currently call Aggieland home. 
                    This is my senior year at Texas A&M (whoop!) where I am pursuing degrees in both statistics and computer science. 
                    My dream is to become a data scientist- a role where I can use my curious and analytical nature to problem-solve and provide meaning to the world around me. 
                    I will graduate in May 2021 and am excited to see what's next!</p>

                <p><i>"Be strong and courageous; don’t be terrified or afraid of them. 
                    For the Lord, your God is the one who will go with you; he will not leave you or abandon you -- Deuteronomy 31:6 (CSB)".</i></p>
                <p> I love the Lord with my whole heart and am thankful for his abounding grace, continual presence, and incredible goodness. 
                    His mercy rescues me every day! Being a member of and serving my church is a huge part of my life.</p>

                <p> Family means the world to me! 
                    Living just a few minutes away from grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins my whole life has been a huge blessing. 
                    I am incredibly grateful for the care, encouragement, and love my family has endlessly showered me with. 
                    Time spent together is sweet and full of laughs (and good food)!</p>

                <h2>Travel</h2>
                <p>Many of my most treasured memories were made while traveling!
                    Hiking up mountains, strolling along the beach, walking through historical villages – all of these fulfil my love for adventure. 
                    This past summer, a “mom & me” trip to Yellowstone National Park bumped my state count to 35.
                    One day I hope to step foot in all 50! </p>

                <h2>Activities</h2>
                <p> For my first three years of college, I participated in Phi Lamb - a Christian sorority where I formed many close friendships while worshipping and serving our community!
                    Studying abroad in France in Summer 2018 is a highlight of my college experience.
                    Starting my sophomore year, I helped to form TAMU Datathon - a data science and machine learning hackathon boasting over 2000+ applicants.
                    My church home group, Chariots of Fire, has also brought me a lot of joy the past few years. </p>
