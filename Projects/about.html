            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p> I am a Dallas native but currently call Aggieland home. 
                This is my senior year at Texas A&M (whoop!) where I am pursuing degrees in both statistics and computer science. 
                My dream is to become a data scientist- a role where I can use my curious and analytical nature to problem-solve and provide meaning to the world around me. 
                I will graduate in May 2021 and am excited to see what the future will hold!</p>

            <h2>Family</h2>
            <p> Family means the world to me! 
                Living just a few minutes away from grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins my whole life has been a huge blessing. 
                I am incredibly grateful for the care, encouragement, and love my family has endlessly showered me with. 
                Time spent together is sweet and full of laughs (and good food)!</p>

    <h2>Faith</h2>
    <p> “Be strong and courageous; don’t be terrified or afraid of them. 
        For the Lord, your God is the one who will go with you; he will not leave you or abandon you -- Deuteronomy 31:6 (CSB)”. 
        I love the Lord with my whole heart and am thankful for his abounding grace, continual presence, and incredible goodness. 
        His mercy rescues me every day.</p>
    <h2>Travel</h2>
    <p>Many of my most treasured memories were made while traveling!
        Hiking up mountains, strolling along the beach, walking through historical villages – all of these fulfil my love for adventure. 
        This past summer, a “mom & me” trip to Yellowstone National Park bumped my state count to 35.
        One day I hope to step foot in all 50! </p>
    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>I never run out of ideas for ways to fill my spare time! 
        Competitive sports were a big part of my childhood, so I love playing volleyball, tennis, basketball, and soccer whenever I get a chance. 
        Music is another activity I enjoy as well; I play the piano and am (slowly) learning the guitar. </p>
